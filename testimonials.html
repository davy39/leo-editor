Leo lets me arrange the URLs in a hierarchy (or multiple hierarchies), attach notes to them, save clippings of things I read on the sites.

Of course, it&#8217;s basically alone in this field, as far as I know, but I&#8217;m sure it would do well even if it wasn&#8217;t :-). Take out the Python part, and maybe there&#8217;re some others out there, but who&#8217;d want to take out the Python part :) I guess Emacs is sort of an environment like this, only in Lisp with a prehistoric GUI system.
Sometimes I&#8217;ve wondered why Leo seems to appeal to people who aren&#8217;t comfortable in Python, I think now it&#8217;s because they still recognize the value of an <em>environment</em>, and there&#8217;s just not much in this niche.
My feeling, talking generally and not about Leo in particular, is that while not everyone needs to be a &#8220;programmer&#8221;, everyone who uses computers would benefit from being able to interact with them with more of the flexibility and efficiency that comes with even relatively simple &#8220;scripting&#8221;, and less of the limitations that come with the &#8220;buy our latest product and you&#8217;ll be able to do   anything you want with a click&#8221; view pushed by other suppliers of computing environments.</p>

<div><p>Leo&#8217;s impact on my life since I found it in January has been substantial.
Leo allows me to automate my life to a great extent. It is my to-do list, my personal assistant, my address book, my password log, my recipe archive, my rss feed reader (due to rss.py), and my favored editor. It partially powers my blog (along with git, ruby, and heroku), allowing me to create a new blog entry with one click and a bit of editing. Viewrendered (with markdown support!) has changed the way I write READMEs and blog posts. On top of all of that, it has allowed to me to organize several disparate tabletop game design projects I have going, as well as my numerous writing projects. Not to mention the impact it has on my ability to understand and decode large python projects!
But what really cinches all of this for me is how crazy extensible Leo is. Script buttons in particular are an integral part of my daily workflow, allowing me to transform my productivity over the last month...I&#8217;m now a thing-getter-doner, and I find much of it is due to the powerful core of Leo, plus scripting.py and todo.py.</p>

<div><p>The outliner format helps me organize/reorganize my thoughts gradually, instead of putting everything in the right place from the beginning. I write a lot of body text with few headlines, and Leo&#8217;s approach leaves lots of space for the body text and therefore suits my workflow. I find that I end up revisiting notes composed on Leo more often than notes slapped into tools like Evernote or random files in the file system.
With Leo, I can interleave &#8220;notes&#8221; (most of the content), generated files and even random data and python scripts to manipulate that data. I process this data in various tools, but Leo helps me group it together in &#8220;project specific&#8221; Leo files.
I know how to script the outline, so I can easily whip up different tools for my needs that deal with the headline structure directly.</p>

<p>August 28, 2002, on <a class="reference external" href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=38848&amp;amp;cid=4171478">slashdot</a>.</p>
<p>Hello, my full name is David Speed Ream. I am known as Speed to friends and
enemies alike, but I gladly answer to David or most any other handle. I am an
unabashed and biased fan of Leo, the fact that it was written by my brother
Edward only slightly coloring my already colored glasses. I have been testing
and using Leo in software production for over 4 years. My company currently has
over 50,000 lines of code in over 100 source files that are written using Leo.</p>
<p>My comments are from two points of view, the first being software project
manager for a complicated, multi-module software product, and the second being
as a production line coder. For me, Leo’s greatest and only real drawback is the
learning curve. This learning curve can be shallow is if all that is required is
that someone code using Leo. However, in our company we allocate 40 to 80 hours
<em>on top</em> of the normal coding load for someone to come up to speed on Leo. The
ROI (return on investment) is calculated by me to be on the order of 3 months.
So if I hire a consultant for less than 3 months, I don’t teach him Leo, even
though all source code in our company must reside in Leo files for the reasons I
won’t go into now.</p>
<p>I consider that my coders are 15 to 30 percent more efficient in their daily
operations than my competition’s people. This indefensible claim of mine is
based on the changes in my productivity as Leo grew from a test document
production tool to the primary production method for all our assembly, c and cpp
source code.</p>
<p>Personally, I hate to deal with documentation when I write code, except:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>When I am first sitting down to solve a new problem.
Then the documentation becomes quite long-winded and pontificatory,
as if I were the only one on earth smart enough to solve the problem - or</li>
<li>When I come back to code I or someone else has written and find the documentation insufficient to
understand the code without study (seems to be most of the time).</li>
</ol>
<p>So I do not require my engineers or myself to do a great job of documentation,
nor do I use Leo for that purpose. Rather, it is Leo’s outlining and organizing
ability, and Leo’s ability to create source files from within the outline that
give me what I think is a tremendous competitive advantage. Each of my company’s
products run on all versions of windows from Win 3.1 to XP. In our flagship
software piece, there are ten main modules, and each module is maintained by one
single Leo file. In the CODEC module, one Leo file named compress.leo organizes
and creates seven .asm files, forty-four .c files, twenty .h files, two .def
files, four .mak files, etc. etc. etc. This one file can be checked out from
source code control and given to an engineer for the addition of a new feature.</p>
<p>In it are contained all the known issues for the CODEC, each issue arranged in
its own clone section. One clone section groups together every routine, variable
or type definition that must change between different versions of Windows. These
sections could be from six different c source files, two assembly files, and
eight .h files. Another clone section groups together those sections relating to
memory problems, which change according to the memory configuration and TSR
configuration (or lack thereof) on the target machine. Another clone section
groups sections that fail (or don’t fail) if the routine in question was
accidentally run during the dreaded ‘interrupt time’. Another clone section is a
section containing clones, each of which is named after the major bug that was
fixed when the engineer who fixed the bug grouped a bunch of routines,
definitions, etc. together to fix the bug.</p>
<p>None of the above clone sections was ‘designed’ into the document. Just the
opposite happens. When the codec was first written, there was just a single Leo
file with a bunch of sections for each c routine or assembly module. As the
product grew and was tested on various platforms, each failure of the module was
organized into clones each time a failure was fixed. This is what I call “SELF
DOCUMENTING CODE”. This has nothing to do with me sitting and documenting
anything. Its just that the STRUCTURE of a bug fix (or product enhancement)
lives on long after the coding is done, as long as no one is foolish enough to
delete the cloned sections that ‘DOCUMENT’ what happened.</p>
<p>In actual practice, this organizational ‘history’ is so powerful that I can’t
begin to describe it. A ‘REVERSE LEARNING CURVE’ happens when an engineer gets a
Leo file that already has the ‘interrupt time sensitive’ routines grouped
together by the last unfortunate soul who had to work on them. There may not be
any more written documentation, but the knowledge contained in the structure can
be breathtaking. It is certainly time saving. I find this particularly true in
my own case. Often I’ll look at some code that seems totally unfamiliar and
think ‘what idiot wrote this crap’. Then I’ll look at the version control
comments and realize that I wrote the crap. Then for sure I know the
documentation is non-existent, but the clones I used to develop it are still
there, and they always serve to refresh my memory in an indescribable way.</p>
<p>Enough of this commentary, I just looked at the clock. Best wishes to anyone
willing to try Leo for a week. I hope you will be glad you did.</p>

<p>The Word outlines are very useful. But Leo makes Word look like a clunky toy.</p>
<p>#1 Reason would probably be clone nodes. One node can point to another. Another
way of putting this is is that a leaf can be on more than one tree. For
example, suppose you have a list of recipes. You simultaneously put a single
recipe under multiple categories or even multiple hierarchies. You could put &#8220;3
bean enchilada&#8221; simultaneously under Recipes-Mexican and Food-Gas. Another
example would be, if you are a biologist trying to decide under which genus to
put a new species, you could put the species under two simultaneously. In
effect, you can build a 3-D tree.</p>
<p>#2 Reason would probably be that Leo outlines can be embedded in external text
files. So, a Leo outline is more than an outline, it is a meta-structure that
can be added to another text without changing that text, but rather providing
an external road map to the text. Microsoft Word has a text (xml) version with a
commenting convention, so Leo can even be used to add outlines into Word docs,
although it isn&#8217;t set up to do that now. For example, see
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.3dtree.com/ev/e/sbooks/leo/sbframetoc_ie.htm">http://www.3dtree.com/ev/e/sbooks/leo/sbframetoc_ie.htm</a> In this case, the upper
window of Leo is the meta-structure, and the bottom window is the file to which
the meta-structure is being applied, viewed one node at a time.</p>
<p>I may not have made #2 very clear, but it is actually a very useful feature. It
takes some getting used to before one sees all of the possibilities tho. One
way to think of it is that Leo allows you to throw external documents into your
outline, and yet the external document remains independent and can still be
edited separately.</p>
<p>Some other cool things about Leo which Word doesn&#8217;t feature:
1. Pure xml output that is easy to transform into other formats (next
version of Word will have true XML format, but not as easy to work with).
One consequence of this is that Leo files can be transformed pretty easily
to web pages with their outlining capability intact.
2. Easy to add features since is programmed in Python and open source. Maybe
your average user can&#8217;t start hacking on it, but a surprising amount can be
tacked on...
3. Free, opensource, multi-platform
4. Leo is scriptable with Python. It should be possible to build a Tickler
into Leo using Python scripting, for example.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id15">Dan Winkler</a><a class="headerlink" href="#dan-winkler" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>First of all, kudos to you for the excellent progress you&#8217;ve been making with
Leo. I upgraded today after about three months of using and older version and I
was thrilled to see all the great improvements that have happened so fast. I
especially love the ability to go to next clone. I think you&#8217;re really showing
what open source can do and your current trajectory puts you on track to kick
Emacs into the dustbin of computing history.</p>
<p>So today I copied all my data (personal information manager and project
management stuff) out of my old outliner (ThoughtManager, which syncs with and
runs on the Palm) and put it into Leo. It took me hours to do it and then to
rearrange it the way I really wanted it. But having the ability to make clones
and have different ways to view my data is, as you know, fabulous. In my case,
for personal information and project management things, I used the flexibility
of clones to allow me to see my data in several different views: 1) by project,
the logical hierarchical breakdown by topic, 2) by person, so whenever I&#8217;m
talking to someone I can easily see all the pending items related to them which
may be spread over multiple projects, 3) by priority, so I can see what needs to
get done sooner and what can wait for later and, 4) a special case of priority
called &#8220;Today&#8221; for the things I&#8217;m going to focus on in the coming hours.</p>
<p>Now here&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t miss the ability of my old outliner to synch the entire
outline with the Palm. It turns out the main thing I really want in the Palm is
the top category &#8220;Today&#8221; so all I have to do is have Leo flatten that one
heading into a text file (and it kindly remembers the name and directory of the
file I used last time) and then I&#8217;m done because I&#8217;ve told the Palm Hotsync
manager that that file should be sent to Palm memo pad every time I synch. The
Palm Hotsync manager does a nice job of sending a text file to the Palm memo pad
and even breaks the file up into multiple memo records if it&#8217;s too big to fit in
just one. So that gives me enough to be able to browse (or full text search) the
small amount of data that I really want right inside my Palm (which is also my
cell phone). Quick and dirty but it works.</p>
<p>For times when I want my whole outline with me, Leo wins again because thanks to
its cross platform nature I can take my whole outline with me on my Mac iBook,
even though I usually edit it on a Windows PC (which is the only kind of machine
my old outliner would run on). Quite frankly, although my old outliner was able
to shoehorn the whole thing into my palm/cellphone, it was a pain to access it
on the small screen and slow processor. Now when I anticipate I&#8217;ll need the
whole thing, for example when I&#8217;m going to a meeting, I can put it on my Mac
iBook (under X and Fink for now until Python can do it native under Aqua) and
have real, full access to it all.</p>
<p>I think now in addition to being great for programming Leo is also a great PIM.
Being able to flatten a strategically chosen portion of the outline into a known
file name that the Palm synch manager has been told to send to the Palm on every
synch does the trick for me. I wonder if you would consider something like an
&#64;flatten directive so I can have that done automatically for me every time I
save my outline? For now it&#8217;s up to me to flatten the node I want manually,
although once I&#8217;ve done that the transfer to the Palm is automatic.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re my hero! Thank you so much.</p>

<p>Another day, another breakthrough using Leo&#8211;now I realize Leo is the
best URL bookmark manager there is.  No more bookmarks menus or
favorites lists inside the browser for me.  With the &#64;url directive I
can just double click on the URL to open it in my browser.  Leo lets me
arrange the URLs in a hierarchy (or multiple hierarchies), attach notes
to them, save clippings of things I read on the sites.  It&#8217;s sooo much
better than anything the browsers have built in and it lets me easily
use different browsers on different platforms and different machines
(try that with the browsers&#8217; built-in bookmark managers).</p>
<p>When using Leo as a project manager and personal information manager as
I do I can heavily annotate every task and project with helpful and
relevant URLs.  And since URLs can be of the <a class="reference external" href="file://">file://</a> form, they&#8217;re not
just for web pages or HTML documents;  I can link to any file on my disk
of any type to be opened by any program.</p>
<p>Leo is a quantum leap for me in terms of how many projects I can manage
and how much information I can find and organize and store in a useful
way.  I&#8217;m a data-mining army of one now and the web is my playground.
Every time I find a web page that has interesting links to others,
those links get stored in my Leo outline too, right where I can find
them and make practical use of them.  I can easily accept dozens of
valuable links every day and integrate them into what I&#8217;m doing in a way
that I&#8217;m confidant they won&#8217;t get lost or forgotten.  Before I always
used to get bogged down by the difficulty of managing bookmarks inside
the browser.  But now I&#8217;m no longer the victim of information overload
buried in the knowledge landslide of the Internet;  instead I&#8217;m the
professional strip miner with the world&#8217;s biggest bulldozer.  I eagerly
plunge into mountains of data and emerge with all the valuable
information nuggets neatly stored and organized.  And my storehouse of
knowledge is a flexible thing where I can reorganize and prioritize and
massage the data to my heart&#8217;s content as I learn more about it and
decide to use it in different ways for different purposes.  It&#8217;s the
difference between the pick axe and the steam shovel for me.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id17">Dan Winkler 3</a><a class="headerlink" href="#dan-winkler-3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This year my accountant is getting a beautiful printout generated by LaTeX and
Leo. I have a complicated tax situation this year, but I got it all laid out and
organized in Leo. Then I had each of the nodes that had something my accountant
needs to see write the data out to a file in the form a LaTeX table.</p>
<p>Sometimes a row of a table would have a result that was calculated by adding up
a list of numbers. For that I used the modern day equivalent of an adding
machine paper tape&#8211;I stored a lisp s-expression in a Leo comment. I like
s-expressions for this because once I put the opening &#8220;(+&#8221; on one line and the
closing &#8221;)&#8221; on another line, I can fill in additional numbers just by typing
them and can even annotate them with comments. So in the middle of generating a
LaTeX file I might have something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>@
(+
1165.26 1823.70 ; May 2002
123.38 ; June 2002
13.50 ; July 2002
13.21 ; October 2002
55.25 ; November 2002
)
@c
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>That&#8217;s an annotated record of how I arrived at the number the accountant will
actually see. I can just paste it into any lisp or scheme interpreter and get
the total. Adding additional numbers is easy.</p>
<p>For next year, I think I might take this a step further. What I did
this year is good for adding up numbers to get a total for one row of
a LaTeX table. But it turns out I&#8217;d also like some more processing
done on those tables (which I had to do by hand this time&#8211;I&#8217;d like
the rows sorted in reverse order by magnitude (so that the big numbers
jump out at you from the start of the tables) and I&#8217;d like a total of
all the rows in the table. So I think next year, instead of having an
s-expression that computes the total of one row for me, I think I&#8217;ll
use s-expressions that generate whole tables, formatted for LaTex,
from the underlying data. So I&#8217;m thinking next year my s-expressions
might look more like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>@
(table &quot;Widget Related Expenses&quot;
    (&quot;widget insurance&quot; (+

                    13.50 ; July 2002
                    13.21 ; October 2002

)

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The job of that &#8220;table&#8221; function would be to return the LaTeX code
needed to display a table with the category names and values, sorted
descending by magnitude, with the total displayed. It&#8217;s sort of a poor
man&#8217;s way of doing a spreadsheet inside Leo and then making it look
great using LaTeX. The idea would be as I wanted to add more data, I&#8217;d
add it to the s-expression and then reevaluate the whole thing by
pasting it into a lisp interpreter and then copying the result back
into the same Leo node for LaTeX to process.&#8212;Dan</p>

<p>&#8220;Not sure why you said &#8216;you can specify a computer program as an
outline like thing in an outliner like setting.&#8217; Why not just say,
&#8216;write a computer program in an outline?&#8217; Is there some nuance I am
missing?&#8221;&#8212;EKR</p>
<p>There are probably a million reasons I said it like that, but I think
the main one is my everpresent, brightly burning belief that a program
should be designed before its coded. Remember those guys, back in the
day, who after receiving their programming assignment, would go to the
keyboard and start pounding out C code? Remember their finished
product? Remember how long it took them to finally complete the
project?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, when receiving an assignment, I&#8217;d spend hours to days with
a bunch of paper, drawing diagrams. By the time I sat down at the
terminal, I knew my data structures and algorithms. The hours to days
head start of the &#8220;start coding immediately&#8221; guys evaporated because
for me, coding was just a secretarial task, and I was required to do
less refactoring, or even worse, kludging. Later, sometimes I&#8217;d
substitute an outliner for the diagrams on paper; in the days of
functional decomposition, an outliner was the perfect fit.</p>
<p>Back to your question: If all I needed to do was <strong>write</strong> a program,
I&#8217;d just sit down at a computer and start pounding out C or Python or
Lua or whatever. But that&#8217;s not my style. I need to <strong>design</strong> a
program, and after all, a design is just a specification of how the
program is going to be written.</p>
<p>So it seems to me that I <em>design</em> the program on Leo, and then, when
the time comes, I flip a switch and Leo <em>writes</em> the program for me.
That&#8217;s how I&#8217;d view what I&#8217;ve heard about Leo.</p>
